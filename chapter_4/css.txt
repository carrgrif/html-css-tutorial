Notes

* Style sheet - a list of CSS rules/rule sets
* Selectors - the things that target the elements that we want to style (e.g. div, li, etc.)
* Declarations - key/value pairs that tell us what type of styling (e.g. color: red;)
* Can have as many declarations as we want in each selector

How Can We Add CSS to HTML?
* Add directly in tags
* Create external style sheet (preferred method)

Inline Elements
* Don't take up any more room than their content needs
* span, img, strong, em, a and more...

Block-level Elements
* Take up the whole width of a page regardless of content
* p, div, h1, h2, h3, ul, li and more...

Margin & Padding
* Margin controls spacing outside of the border
* Padding controls spacing within the border
E.g.
####################################
#            margin                #
####################################
#            padding               #
####################################
#                                  #
#             div                  #
#                                  #
####################################
#            padding               #
####################################
#            margin                #
####################################

* Block-level elements can have margin all the way around the element
* Inline elements can only have margin to the left or right of the element
* Padding can go all the way around for both types of elements
* Be careful of padding collapse for inline elements as the page gets smaller
* Margin for block elements isn't always going to be the 2 margins combined (e.g. two div elements on
top of each other, each has 20px margin - only ends up being 20px apart, not 40px)

Default Browser Styles
* Styles that are already applied to elements by a browser (e.g. an anchor tag is underlined, highlighted blue/purple)
* Allows us to tell what type of element it is without an explicit CSS
