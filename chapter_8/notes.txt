Position and Layout

- Static: doesn't change (default value, can be used to put something back into normal position if it was changed)
- Relative: moves the element to a spot from the original position where the element is defined (element space doesn't change, the value just gets moved)
- Fixed: An element will be fixed given the appropriate parameters  (e.g. a header gets fixed to the top of the page no matter where you scroll)
- Absolute: An element is placed in absolute position in regards to its parent position property (space is not retained)
    parent element must be positioned properly (not absolute)
    position absolute on the element we want to position the element
    then left, right, top, or bottom to alter the element's location
- Sticky: a mixture of fixed and static
