** The Cascade **

Inheritance
- HTML elements can inherit CSS properties that are applied to their parents
- E.g.
<div>
    <p>Hello, <span>world!</span></p>
</div>

Styled with:
div {
    color: red;
}

- Will make all elements within the div have red text
- Not all properties are inherited - margin, padding, background styles, etc. are not
- Mainly ones like font, text color/styles that are inherited
